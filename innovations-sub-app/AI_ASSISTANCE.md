# AI Assistance Recognition

This project was developed with the assistance of **Google DeepMind's Gemini**, an advanced multimodal AI model.

Gemini provided support in:
-   **Code Generation:** Writing and refactoring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the Innovations sub-app.
-   **Documentation:** Drafting `README.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other documentation files.
-   **Architecture Planning:** Assisting with the structural design of the sub-application and its integration within the Innovana ecosystem.
-   **Problem Solving:** Identifying and resolving technical issues during development.

We acknowledge the power of AI collaboration in accelerating innovation and development workflows.
